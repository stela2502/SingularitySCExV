# SingularitySCExV

This is a failed project. I have added this github repo here to remind me to not try it again.

The step that made me stop is the temp folder SCExV would need for every run. To actually support a user specififc temp folder while still being able to start the nginx web server is out of my reach at the moment. And I do not think the SCExV server is worth my time. The data it is analyzing is not up to date any more:

If you think about creating a Fluidigm dataset - Stop. I strongly recommend you to look into any single cell sequencing application instead. There are tons of good software to analyze this kind of information whereas there is hardly any good software that does this for Fluidigm data. Go with the masses and invest in single cell sequencing instead. Rare expression is in fact a problem still, but your main research idea will likely still be in better hands with single cell sequencing than with Fluidigm. Even the normalization of Fluidigm data is not really stable. Think about this. Do you want to have these problems?
